  O Christ, our true and on -- ly light,
  Il -- lu -- mine those who sit in night;
  Let those a -- far now hear your voice,
  And in your fold with us re -- joice.
}

verseTwo = \lyricmode {

  Lord, gent -- ly seek _ gone a -- stray,
  That they may fol -- low in your way.
  Your heal -- ing grace let them be giv'n,
  That they may one day share your heav'n.
}

verseThree = \lyricmode {
  \set stanza = #"3."
  Make those in doubt, now share your word,
  And teach them to pro -- fess it, Lord,
  Who dare not yet the faith a -- vow,
  Though se -- cret -- ly they hold it now.
}

verseFour = \lyricmode {
  \set stanza = #"4."
  Shine on the dark -- ened and the cold,
  Re -- call the wan -- d'rers from your fold,
  Those now u -- nite who walk a -- part
  Con -- firm the weak and doubt -- ing heart.
}

verseFive = \lyricmode {
  \set stanza = #"5."
  So they with us may ev -- er -- more
  Such grace with won -- d'ring -- thanks a -- dore;
  And end -- less praise to you be giv'n
  By all your Church in earth and heav'n.
